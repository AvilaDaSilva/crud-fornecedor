## What is necessary

For this project, you can use what DB you want. But I'm using MySQL;
For the server you can use the artisan and start by the command bellow in the root project directory:
 - php artisan serve --port=8080
But I'm using XAMPP properly configured

## How to

To install the project, first, you have to clone this repository, then create a new DB called crud-fornecedor as the command bellow:
 - CREATE DATABASE crud-fornecedor;

OBS: To write this project I was using this information to DB connection:
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=crud_fornecedor
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
If you want to use something different, or your local base is using other information to connect, please edit the file with the right information:
 - /.env

After that, use the migration command, in the root project directory, to create the tables:
 - php artisan migrate

And it's done, you can start to code, or test the project

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
